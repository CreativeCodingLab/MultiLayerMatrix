### MultiLayerMatrix: Visualizing Large Taxonomic Datasets
MultiLayerMatrix is a new scalable technique to visualize very large matrices by breaking them into multiple layers: the top layer shows the relationships between different groups of clustered data while each sub-layer shows the relationships between nodes in each group as needed. This process can be applied iteratively to create multiple sub-layers for very large datasets. In the following figure, we illustrate the usefulness of MultiLayerMatrix by applying it to a network representing similarity measures between 2,048 characters in the Asteraceae taxonomy, a rich dataset that describes characteristics of species of flowering plants. We also discuss the scalability of our technique by investigating its effectiveness on a large synthetic dataset with 20,000 columns by 20,000 rows that is initially clustered into 50 distinct groups, and that can then be interactively investigated to examine a further level of detail within a selected cluster.
